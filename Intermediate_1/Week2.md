# Combining Text (CONCAT, &)

### Improving Employee Database

To enhance the current employee database, Uma has been tasked with listing the full name of each employee in column D and adding all employees' email addresses in column E. This task can be accomplished using the CONCAT function in Excel. However, for users with older versions of Excel or working on Mac, the CONCATENATE function can be used, which operates similarly to CONCAT.

### Using CONCAT Function

The CONCAT function concatenates or links together different text strings. It requires providing exact instructions, including the elements to be concatenated and any necessary separators. Here's how to use it:

1. Type an equal sign in the cell where the result should appear.
2. Start typing the first three letters of the CONCAT function name, then use the arrow keys to select it.
3. Define the first value, followed by a comma.
4. Include any necessary separators, such as spaces or punctuation, within quotation marks.
5. Repeat for each element to be concatenated.
6. Press Enter to see the result.
7. Double click the fill handle in the cell to copy the formula down.

#### CONCAT Function:
```excel
=CONCAT("First Name", ", ", "Last Name")
```

### Using Ampersand Sign

Alternatively, the Ampersand (&) sign can be used as a quick and simple way to link text together. This method involves directly combining text strings without using a specific function. Here's how to use it:

1. Type an equal sign in the cell where the result should appear.
2. Combine text strings by using the Ampersand sign (&).
3. Encase any fixed text elements, such as domain names, in quotation marks.
4. Press Enter to see the result.
5. Double click the fill handle in the cell to copy the formula down.

### Ampersand Sign Function

```excel
="First Name" & "." & "Last Name" & "@pushpin.com"
```

Both the CONCAT function and the Ampersand sign offer efficient ways to join data from separate columns. Remember to review the syntax for each approach and encase text elements in quotation marks when necessary. Additionally, check the Toolbox for more details on the syntax and consider using functions to fix any remaining issues in the database.
